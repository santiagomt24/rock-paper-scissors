# rock-paper-scissors
JavaScript project.
In this version the game Rock Paper Scissors was updated from the last one.
Mainly the work was focused on writng a JS file that interacts with the HTML by manipulating the DOM,
turning into a more interactive website.
Also a CSS file was attached to bring some design into the page.
